# Internet of Things (IoT) Platform

This is a simple Java-based implementation of an Internet of Things (IoT) platform. It provides basic functionality for registering devices, updating device properties, and retrieving device properties.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment or compile and run the `Main.java` file from the command line.

## Application Overview

The IoT platform consists of two main components:

1. **Device**: This class represents an IoT device with an ID, name, and a map of properties. It provides methods to set and get device properties.
2. **IoTPlatform**: This class manages the registered devices and provides methods for device registration, updating device properties, and retrieving device properties.

The `Main` class demonstrates the usage of the `IoTPlatform` class by performing the following actions:

- Registering devices
- Updating device properties
- Retrieving device properties

You can modify the code in the `Main` class to experiment with different scenarios or integrate it with your existing IoT applications.

## Limitations

This implementation is a basic example and does not include advanced features such as:

- Device communication
- Data persistence
- Security mechanisms
- Integration with IoT protocols and messaging systems

In a real-world IoT platform, you would need to incorporate these additional components and functionalities.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
